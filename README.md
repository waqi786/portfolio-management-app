# portfolio-management-app
This application is a web-based portfolio management tool built using Flask. It allows users to log in, manage their stock portfolio, and analyze their investments' performance. The app fetches stock data from Yahoo Finance, calculates cumulative returns, volatility, and the Sharpe ratio, and visualizes the data using Plotly.
